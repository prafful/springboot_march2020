Application.java (Spring boot application entry point!) creates handle to the spring container!

Spring container is responsible for lifecycle of all beans!

it will look for components (all beans -> rest controllers, services, interfaces, dao classes, exception class, pojo classes, validation classes, utility classes!) in the same/child package  as that of application.java

If beans are in seperate/sibling package, then path of package MUST be supplied to Application.java
